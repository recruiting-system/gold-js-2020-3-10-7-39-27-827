/**
 * This function turns the specified string into camel cased identifier. Camel case (stylized
 * as camelCase; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice
 * of writing phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins
 * with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation. For example.
 *
 * - `safe hTML` -> `safeHtml`
 * - `escape HTML entities` -> `escapeHtmlEntities`
 *
 * The identifier should only contains english letters (`A` to `Z`, including upper and
 * lower case), digits (`0` to `9`) and underscore (`_`). Other characters will be treated
 * as delimiters. For example.
 *
 * - `safe+html` -> `safeHtml`
 *
 * @param {String} string The input string.
